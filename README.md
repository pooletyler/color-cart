Things I would change given UX approval:

1.  A lot of the text is hard to read ont he page and the plethora of colors leads to accessibility issues with the white text. It needs a stroke or shadow.
2.  The white trashcan is probable failing accessibility on the cart page as well for blending in too closely.
